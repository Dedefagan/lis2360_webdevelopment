<h1>Your Skin Care Routine</h1>
<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
        
        <p> Everyone should be taking precaution on what brand of water they drink. Water you consume can determine how bright your day will be or ache your body with the minerals you take in depending on how much more the water is alkaline or acidic. So it only makes sense for me to inform you on water brands you should drink. </p>
       
<h2>Why Drink Alkaline Water</h2>

        <p>While there isnt many studies on alkaline water. The few that was counted stated a plethera of facts that alkaline water can improve health of humanity. Alkaline can improve many health componets for people with high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol according to an Healthline article "Alkaline Water: Benefits and Risks". In the article, it includes that alkaline water can do many things includes <ol> <li> Colon cleaning</li> <li> Immune system support</li> <li> hydration, skin health</li> <li> Weight loss</li> <li> Cancer resistance</li></ol> </p>
        
        <p><br> According to NY Times paper "Is Alkaline Water Relly Better for You" written by Alice callahan in order for Alkaline water to be alkaline water it has to have an higher PH level of 7.1 and any more than that would be more acidic. While Pure water has a neutral pH level of 7. Also according to Tenspringwater, it has a list of water bottled and their pH level.   </p>
